                    <p>I spent my birthday in 2025 on a long bike ride' skirting along the edge of the water for dozens of kilometres' eventually ending up at a familiar thrift store on my way back. As my eyes skimmed the shelves' and was intrigued by a vintage Penguin Classic spine set in Univers: <i>The Pillow Book of Sei Shonagon</i></p>
                    <p>I picked it up and started reading it shortly after while I ate my lunch the next time I stopped. I was sucked in instantly—it's like essays of Samuel Johnson' but written seven hundred years earlier in a completely different world. I thoroughly enjoyed this book; I loved the mundane observations' stories and opinions of Sei Shonagon.</p>
                    <p>This book is the diary of the aforementioned Lady in Waiting from late 990's Japan. This page features some of my favourite writings.</p>

                    <h3>No. 36 – Seasonal palace festivals</h3>
                    <div class="subheading-date"></div>
                    <p>Of the five seasonal palace festivals, none is better than the fifth month’s. I love the way the scents of sweet flag and wormwood blend on this day, and another striking thing about the day is the way everywhere, from the ‘nine-fold palace’ to the houses of unmentionably common folk, people compete to spread their roof thick with all the sweet flag and wormwood they can lay hands on. After all, when has this ever been known to happen in any other festival?</p>
                    <p>The sky is generally heavy with cloud. The Bureau of Clothing sends across to the Empress’s palace the little decorative herbal balls that are hung for this festival, with a colourful array of braided threads dangling from them, and we put them up on the pillars to the left and right of Her Majesty’s curtained dais in the Inner Chamber. We tie them up in place of the chrysanthemums that have been hanging there, wrapped in plain gossamer-silk cloth, ever since the Chrysanthemum Festival in the ninth month, which we now throw away. I wonder if in fact the herbal balls in turn shouldn’t stay up till the next Chrysanthemum Festival, but in reality the coloured threads all get pulled off before long and used for tying things.</p>
                    <p>Her Majesty is served special festival food, and the younger girls put sweet-flag herbal balls at their waists, and special sweet-flag abstinence charms in their hair, and tie delightful little sprigs of seasonal plants on to long sweet-flag stems with dappled cord and attach them to their Chinese jackets or over-robes. Of course I can’t claim there’s anything rare and special about all this, still it’s most delightful. After all, the cherry blossom blooms every year, but does anyone find it the less lovely for that?</p>
                    <p>It’s also rather fun to watch how all the little lower-class girls who play outside do their best to deck themselves out as smartly as they can, and go about constantly looking at their own clothes and comparing them with others’, absolutely bursting with pride in their sweet-flag decorations, till one of the guards’ children comes along and playfully tugs them off, and they dissolve in tears. And then there’s the delightful custom of finely wrapping a spray of purple melia flowers around purple paper, or a sweet-flag leaf around leaf-green paper, or in the case of white paper a white sweet-flag root. And the sight of a lovely long sweet-flag root enclosed with a letter gives a wonderfully elegant feel. It’s also quite charming to see women huddled intimately together sharing the letters they’ve just received, as they discuss how to respond. Those who are involved in exchanges with a young lady or with someone in high places write particularly careful and elegant letters on this day. Indeed the whole day, down to the way the hototogisu gives its signature cry as it flies past in the gathering twilight, is utterly wonderful.</p>

                    <h3>No. 38 – Birds</h3>
                    <div class="subheading-date"></div>
                    <p>Although it comes from another land' the parrot is a very touching bird. It apparently mimics things people say. Then there's the hototogisu' the water-rail' the snipe' the oystercatcher' the siskin and the flycatcher.</p>
                    <p>The mountain dove is a very pure-hearted and touching bird– they say it can be comforted by showing it a mirror when it's longing for its mate. It's heart-breaking to imagine how they feel when they sleep separated for thenight by a ravine.</p> 
                    <p>The crane is a most ostentatious-looking bird' but there's a magnificence in the way its cry reaches the very heavens.</p>
                    <p>The red-headed sparrow' the male grosbeak and the wren. The heron looks quite horrible. The look in its eye is unpleasant' and indeed there's absolutely nothing lovable about it' but on the other hand it's charming to recall how they vie with each other 'and will not sleep alone'.</p> 
                    <p>Among the water birds' the mandarin duck is very touching in the way' for instance' the pair will change places on cold nights to brush the frost from each other's wings.</p>
                    <p>The plover too is a very interesting bird.</p>
                    <p>The uguisu is made out to be a wonderful bird in Chinese poetry' and both its voice and its appearance are really so enchanting that it's very unseemly of it not to sing inside the grounds of our 'nine-fold palace'.</p>
                    <p>People did tell me this was so but I couldn't believe it' yet during my ten years in the palace I did indeed never once hear it. This despite the fact that the palace is near bamboo groves and there are red plums' which would make it a fine place for an uguisu to come and go. Yet if you go out' you'll hear one singing fit to burst in a nondescript plum tree in some lowly garden. It doesn't sing at night' so it's obviously rather a sleepyhead' but there's no correcting this fault now' I'm afraid. In summer and right through to the end of autumn it maunders on and on in a wavery old voice' and lower sorts of people change its name to 'flycatcher'' which I find quite unfortunate and ludicrous. Though mind you' I probably wouldn't feel so outraged if it was some everyday bird like the sparrow. No doubt I feel this way because the uguisu is so well-loved for the fact that it sings in spring – after all' it appears in Japanese and Chinese poetry with the charming association of 'the changing of the year'. How delightful it would be if it only sang in spring. Yet surely' in the world of humans' no one goes out of their way to run down a person who hasn't really made it in the world' or whose reputation is already on the wane. And no one would pause to savour the sight or the sound of some boring bird such as a kite or a crow. So really' it's precisely because the uguisu is supposed to be such a marvellous bird that one's perversely more aware of its failings.</p>
                    <p>You've gone to watch the Return of the High Priestess after the Kamo Festival' and when you draw up your carriage by Urin'in or Chisokuin Temples' you hear a hototogisu singing with all the irrepressible feeling of this special occasion – then lo and behold' from deep in the high trees an uguisu joins in' in beautifully skilful imitation. It's marvellous to hear them chorusing away together.</p>
                    <p>No words can suffice to express all the delights of the hototogisu. But though it will draw attention to itself by singing very self-importantly' it then has an annoying way of lurking deep among the leaves of a deutzia or orange tree and making itself virtually invisible.</p>
                    <p>You wake during the brief nights of the rainy season and lie there waiting' determined to be the first to hear the bird – then suddenly your heart is utterly transported with delight' as that dear' exquisite voice comes ringing through the darkness.</p>
                    <p>Everything that cries in the night is wonderful. With the exception' of course' of babies.</p>

                    <div class="subheading-date"></div>
                    <p> Summer and winter. Night and day. Rainy days and sunny days. Laughter and anger. Old age and youth. White and black. People you love and those you hate. The man you love and the same man once you've lost all feeling for him seem like two completely different people. Fire and water. Fat people and thin people. People with long hair and those with short hair. </p>
                    <p>The noisy commotion when crows roosting together are suddenly disturbed by something during the night. The way they tumble off their perches' and flap awkwardly about from branch to branch' squawking sleepily' makes them seem utterly different from daytime crows.</p>

                    <h3>No. 32 – The place known as Koshirakawa...</h3>
                    <div class="subheading-date"></div>
                    <p>The place known as Koshirakawa is the home of the Koichijō Commander, and I remember an occasion when the court nobles held a set of Salvation Lotus Discourses here under his auspices. Everyone treated it as a very special event, and we were warned that late carriages wouldn’t be able to find room to stand, so we rose like the dew at daybreak. The place was indeed crammed. The carriages were drawn right up on top of each other as close as possible, shafts overlapping, and the sermon would probably have been somewhat audible at least for the first three rows. It was towards the middle of the sixth month, and the heat was unbelievable. The only way to induce any sense of delicious coolness was to rest your eyes on the lotuses in the pond.</p>
                    <p>Apart from the Ministers of the Left and Right, all the court nobles were present. The younger ones were dressed in lavender gathered trousers and cloaks, with light-blue summer under-robes visible beneath, while those a little older created a wonderfully cool impression in blue-grey gathered trousers and white skirted trousers. Consultant Sukemasa and the others were all looking very youthful, and the whole scene was utterly awe-inspiring and delightful. The blinds around the aisle room had been raised right up, and the court nobles were seated just beyond in a long row above the threshold, facing inward. Next in line behind them were the senior courtiers and younger court nobles, in marvellous ceremonial hunting costumes and cloaks. Many of them were wandering about rather than simply remaining seated, which was great fun to observe. Second of the Watch Sanekata and Adviser Chōmei, being members of the household, were coming and going about the place rather more freely. Those who were still very young also looked quite enchanting.</p>
                    <p>When the sun had risen a little higher, Captain Third Rank Michitaka (as our Regent then was) walked in, dressed in a Chinese-style cloak of lavender silk gauze, with lavender brocade gathered trousers over deep maroon under-trousers, and a shift of brilliant stiff white silk beneath the cloak. Now you’d imagine that in the midst of that assembly of light, cool clothing these clothes would produce a sense of stifling heat, but in fact he looked absolutely splendid. The ribs of people’s fans were variously lacquered or of magnolia wood, but the fans themselves were all of red paper, so the combined effect of them was precisely like a field of blooming pinks.</p>
                    <p>Before the priest had mounted the sermon dais, meal-stands were brought in, and everyone seemed to be served a meal of some kind, though we couldn’t make out what. Counsellor Yoshichika was looking even finer than usual, in fact simply marvellous. There he was, in the midst of these gorgeous colours, such dazzling sheens of summer under-robes that there was no choosing among them for beauty, and he was simplicity itself in his single cloak. He kept looking across towards the ladies’ carriages, and sending messages over to them. No one who saw him could have failed to find him delightful.</p>
                    <p>He watched as one of the carriages that arrived late was drawn in near the pond for lack of room, and then he turned to Sanekata and asked him to call someone who could reliably carry a message. Sanekata chose someone and led him over to Yoshichika, who conferred with those around him about what message to send; I didn’t hear the words they finally decided on, however. Yoshichika watched with a smile as the messenger approached the carriage with ostentatious solemnity. From what I could make out, he went to the rear and delivered his message, and he then stood waiting quite a while to receive her reply.</p>
                    <p>‘She’ll be composing a poem I should think,’ Yoshichika said with a smile, and he turned teasingly to Sanekata and went on, ‘you must prepare an answering one for her.’ Everyone, including the older men and the court nobles, sat looking in the direction of the carriage, eagerly waiting to hear her reply. It was really very funny the way even the bystanders all had their eyes fixed on it.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the messenger began to walk back towards the expectant audience, having apparently been given her message, but at this point the lady suddenly thrust her fan out through the carriage blind and waved him back to her again. Judging from the gesture, you could only conclude that she’d realized she’d made some mistake in the poem’s wording, but I must say I couldn’t help thinking that if it had taken all this time for the poem to emerge in the first place, there should be no reason to be changing it now. Everyone watched his approach in high anticipation. ‘Well, what did she say? What did she say?’ people cried. But they had to wait to hear her response while the messenger first presented himself to Yoshichika, since it was he who had employed him on the errand, and there proceeded to relay his message in a most pompous and painstaking manner.</p>
                    <p>‘Oh hurry up and say it!’ Michitaka broke in impatiently. ‘You’ll ruin the reply if you recite it with such a ridiculous amount of poetic feeling’, and I heard the man say, ‘I wouldn’t be ruining it more than it ruins itself.’ The Fujiwara Grand Counsellor was craning in their direction, particularly eager to hear what it was. I think he asked what she’d said, and Michitaka replied, ‘Well, our “straight tree” seems to have got rather bent.’ The Grand Counsellor burst out laughing, setting off a ripple of laughter throughout the gathering as well, which would certainly have carried to the lady’s carriage. ‘What did the poem originally say before she called you back?’ inquired Yoshichika. ‘Can this really be the improved version?’ ‘I stood there waiting so long that I decided she wasn’t going to reply, but then as I was setting off to return she called me back,’ the messenger replied.</p>
                    <p>‘Whose carriage is it, does anyone know?’ Yoshichika asked curiously, and he was just deciding to try sending a poem this time to see what would happen, when the preacher ascended the dais. With that, everyone fell silent and turned their attention to him, and while no one was looking, the lady’s carriage quietly slipped away. As I recall, the inner blinds of the carriage looked brand new, and the lady’s sleeves revealed scarlet unlined gowns, and a figured lavender Chinese jacket worn over an outer gown of maroon silk gauze, while from the back of the carriage hung her expansively displayed indigo-print train. Who can she have been? But good heavens, I do feel that her reply was perfectly fine in fact, much better than some half-baked response.</p>
                    <p>Seihan, who delivered the morning discourse, was an absolutely glowing presence on the dais, quite wonderful to witness. What with the enervating heat, and the fact that there was work I’d left half done and had to complete that day, I’d decided to stay only a little while to listen and then go home – but when it came to the point, there were such overlapping waves of carriage shafts piled one upon the other that there was no way of extricating myself. Then I decided I must somehow get out as soon as the morning discourse was over, and when I passed on this message to the carriages behind they promptly pulled out to make way for me, presumably delighted at the prospect of thereby getting a bit closer to the dais themselves. Seeing me causing this commotion, many of the men, including some elderly court nobles, sniggered quite loudly in derision, and when I turned a deaf ear and didn’t deign to respond but simply squeezed my way out, Counsellor Yoshichika gave a laugh and remarked, ‘Well, well, “they do well to depart”’, which was wonderfully clever. But I didn’t pay this any heed either and merely continued to make my way out, quite flustered with the heat, simply responding with a parting shot that said, ‘Surely you too can be counted among that five thousand.’</p>
                    <p>There was one carriage that was present from the beginning of the Discourses to the end of the last day. No one ever saw anyone approach it; it just sat there, astonishingly still, for all the world as if it were some carriage in a picture. Yoshichika declared that the lady must be marvellously pious and refined, and wondered what manner of person she was and how he could manage to meet her, but when the Fujiwara Grand Counsellor heard this he said, ‘What’s so marvellous about her? She strikes me as quite creepy and ghastly’, which was very funny.</p>
                    <p>How sad it was when Counsellor Yoshichika suddenly took the tonsure towards the end of that month. It is the way of the world that the flowering blossoms should fall and scatter, but Yoshichika passed from his brief glory even before ‘the dew fell on him’.</p>
