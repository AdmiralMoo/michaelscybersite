                    <p>From time to time, when I find myself in the mood for some good ol' <i>iambic pentameter</i>, I open my copy of <i>The Complete Works of William Shakespeare</i> (wow, I really sound like a nerd, don't I?) and pick a random sonnet. Recently, I read through them all in one go and found that I'd read almost all of them already; this page is a collection of my favourites.<br><br>Prithee, dear reader: do your best impressions of Sir Patrick Stewart.</p>

                                <p>By that sweet ornament which truth doth give.</p>
                                <p>The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem</p>
                                <p>For that sweet odor which doth in it live.</p>
                                <p>The canker blooms have full as deep a dye</p>
                                <p>As the perfumèd tincture of the roses,</p>
                                <p>Hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly</p>
                                <p>When summer’s breath their maskèd buds discloses;</p>
                                <p>But, for their virtue only is their show,</p>
                                <p>They live unwooed and unrespected fade,</p>
                                <p>Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so;</p>
                                <p>Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odors made.</p>
                                <p>And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,</p>

                                <p>Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,</p>
                                <p>And like enough thou know’st thy estimate,</p>
                                <p>The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;</p>
                                <p>My bonds in thee are all determinate.</p>
                                <p>For how do I hold thee but by thy granting?</p>
                                <p>And for that riches where is my deserving?</p>
                                <p>The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,</p>
                                <p>And so my patent back again is swerving.</p>
                                <p>Thy self thou gavest, thy own worth then not knowing,</p>
                                <p>Or me to whom thou gav’st it else mistaking;</p>
                                <p>So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,</p>
                                <p>Comes home again, on better judgement making.</p>
                                <p>Thus have I had thee, as a dream doth flatter,</p>
                                <p>In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.</p>

                                <p>Love’s eye is not so true as all men’s “no.”</p>
