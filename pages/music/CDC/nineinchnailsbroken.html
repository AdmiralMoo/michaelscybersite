        <h2>First Impressions</h2>
        <p>I used to not like digipaks - the style of packaging this CD comes in. I've always thought them inferior to jewel cases because they don't protect the disc and the artwork as well. I don't like how they so easily degrade and get damaged. If you knock a jewel case off onto the floor, you can replace one of three components and everything is still protected inside. A digipak? One chance at life, just like all the rest of us. I started warming up to them after realizing I can't get everything in a jewel case, though I still try. The exemplary presentation of this release in digipak form really changed my perception of them. </p>
        <p>As I carefully slide this mildly worn cardboard casing out of it's polyurethane protective sleeve, I'm once again struck at how well it's built and how good it looks. <i>Broken</i> is the first release that made me think, "wow, this is really cool and I couldn't get this experience with a jewel case". When you open the front flap, it exposes another flap which opens to the right, and a third which opens to the bottom. Each flap is emblazoned with a fiery orange picture with the letters N, I and N - the commonly used abbreviation of Nine Inch Nails. The presentation is impeccable. I love the fonts, the packaging, the imagery and just everything about the outside and inside of this release. I'd never heard this before I got it in the mail, and the packaging made a really good first impression on me before I'd even opened the disc tray on my CD player. </p>
        <h2>The Music</h2>
        <p>The album starts off with an instrumental intro, “Pinion”. A pinion is the small gear connected to the motor which drives the rest of the mechanism. It gets things started, and that perfectly describes this song's place in the EP. It fades in from nothing into a harsh, loud, repeating guitar riff which builds up tension and excitement for what's to come. The chunky riff gets louder and louder over the course of a minute until it drops you straight into the fast paced action that is <i>Broken</i>.  </p>
        <p>“Wish”, the second track on the EP, starts off with the steady beat of drum machines and leads into a clearly sung chorus of Trent Reznor singing about unfulfilled desires and dissatisfaction. Through snarled lyrics and angered breathing, Reznor screams over loud, distorted guitars throughout the chorus. They're very noisy and could almost be described as very metal, though they don't quite fit in with the typical sound of metal guitars. They're more abrasive and are cut off sharply. Most of the instruments on this album, just like on <i>Pretty Hate Machine</i> are slathered with a healthy amount of gated reverb. You can hear it in the drums, in the sharp stop-and-go tones of the guitars and the punchy, low basslines. The guitars on this track in particular sound washy, as if water was being poured over them as they loudly sang this tale of frustration. It's one of those special nuances of the album that I didn't hear the first few times I listened to it because I wasn't listening through headphones. Just when I thought I knew it well, these effects jumped out at me. This EP is filled with a lot of those pleasant surprises. Throughout the song, it's apparent that many of the mixing and techniques, effects, sampling and setups have remained from <i>Pretty Hate Machine</i>. Towards the end of the track, I was pleasantly surprised to hear that percussive chucking sound between strumming which I associate with energetic punk rock.  </p>
        <p>"Wish" really serves as a tone-setting declaration of the pace and sound for this EP. It presents the listener with all the new skills that have been picked up between this and the last album and leaves you wanting more. It has all the hallmarks of a relentlessly fast paced and catchy song that gets you hooked and makes you want to listen over and over again. <i>Broken</i> gives me that huge, fast-paced injection of dopamine that I get from thrash metal and punk rock. If you liked "Mr. Self Destruct" and "The Hand That Feeds" off <i>The Downward Spiral</i> and <i>With Teeth</i> respectively, they fucked while listening to "Closer" and had five kids: all of which are featured back to back to back on this fiery EP. When I first listened to <i>The Downward Spiral</i>, I wished that Nine Inch Nails would make a whole album of songs like “Mr. Self Destruct”, and this is exactly what I wished for. This EP sacrifices the complex progressions found on the band's first album and pivots towards the raw, straightforward aggression favoured by later works.  </p>
        <p>“Last” bursts into your ears with a thundering, stomping beat. The vocals are more distorted and strained than the previous track, and the angst and anger is immediately felt and stepped up a notch. This is a bit slower paced than the last, but that just means that you can bang your head to it. It's a powerful track with a raw, industrial sound featuring some really exciting, intense drumming. The lyrics convey a sense of resignation, finality, and of course, frustration. This song could almost serve as a buildup to the overall theme of the next album. It seems to describe someone experiencing a frenetic downward spiral, and their attempt to patch it up quickly so that they can get their shit back together. They're not at their breaking point where they fall apart, but they're close. They're frustrated. I know how it feels to be living in this ultimately badass industrial metal song. Maybe it just reflects where Reznor was personally at the time, but it feels like it lines up with the theme of <i>The Downward Spiral</i>. In the quiet moments, it sounds like it could be <i>Pretty Hate Machine</i>. In the loud moments, it sounds like <i>The Downward Spiral</i>. Last is a very visceral and raw song and I love the vocals on it. It sticks in your mind. Following in the footsteps of the previous song and the template of the album in general, this is a relentlessly driving song. I love the multitracking and sampling on it. </p>
        <p>The fourth track, “Help Me I am in Hell”, is a departure from the fast paced and loud sound present on the first two songs. It's a fully instrumental track which both builds more tension and diffuses the tension from the previous two songs. It gives you a chance to take a breath and recharge after the previous two songs. The inclusion of this track is part of what contributes to my overall feeling that this is such a polished and complete work. It's not just a typical EP with tracks thrown together. No - this is a full on production. Lots of effort, heart and soul went into this. It marks a transitional period in the band's sound between their first effort and their seminal breakout album. Instead of the punchy, distorted and prominent bass found in the songs on the former, the bass really takes a back seat and echoes amongst the ambient noise and samples in the background. The ambient nature of the track feels like it could've been ripped from some part of the <i>Quake</i> soundtrack or <i>The Downward Spiral</i>. </p>
        <p>There's some samples mixed in too, of course, but they're different than what we usually hear. These aren't synthetic, harsh, machine-like samples that we're used to hearing. These are much warmer and more organic. After around a minute in, you start to hear a thumping or exploding. It becomes more and more prominent as the strumming and droning fades out. I'm amazed at how Trent Reznor is able to mix this; I was standing in front of my stereo the first time I noticed it, and I could hear those sounds behind me, and beside me. I wasn't wearing headphones, and he made me feel like I was. Listening to it with headphones, it's shocking how much these sounds have been manipulated to feel like they're around you. There's a track on the Quake soundtrack which uses the techniques explored here to the effect that it feels as if the song is reaching down into your throat to put you off and make you shift in your seat. That's something that only Trent Reznor can do in the way that he does. I'm often captivated by the sound of these explosions and put into a trance-like state before having “Happiness in Slavery” explode in my face.  </p>
        <p>This song fucks hard; it's easily my favourite on the EP. It's loud, heavy, noisy and screams visceral angst and bitterness through clever wordplay. I love the lyrical content on this song and the way that it's sung. It once again kicks the angst and anger up another couple notches as every heavy track does on this EP. It incorporates those drums with the satisfying, almost danceable beat and gated reverb, while mashing heavy industrial metal guitar riffs and distorted screaming together. The delivery of those lyrics throughout this polished masterpiece is impeccable. I love it.  </p>
        <p>This song is could be about dealing with a record label, but it also serves as a commentary on society - and we're the slaves. Even in our cushy North American first world lives, we are slaves to our employers, the corporations which own us, our religions and our governments. Trent Reznor is able to write about these simple facts of life and the dark things he's going through, but he's able to generalize it in a way where it becomes easy for anyone to relate to and apply to their own lives. He oftentimes reaches so deep within himself that he finds core insecurities, fears and hidden thoughts that are found in all of us. Should we open our eyes and be satisfied with what we have? Or will we trust our masters when they tell us that we have it good and we shouldn't complain? We're all stuck in this hamster wheel routine that is life, and we can't get off. If we choose to open our eyes and try to change the status quo - in not only the world but our own lives - we'll "stick our hands into the cage of this endless machine", and we'll be "just some flesh caught in this big broken machine". "Don't open your eyes you won't like what you see. The blind have been blessed with security. Don't open your eyes, take it from me. I have found you can find happiness is slavery " are some of my favourite lyrics in any song.  </p>
        <p>“Gave Up” opens up with some wet ambient samples and almost tricks you into thinking that it's going to be another interlude before breaking into quick fire drum beats and more bitter vocals washed over with some sort of tremolo or flange effect. It has a really good beat to it and features <i>Pretty Hate Machine</i> like samples. It's as if Reznor is descending further into despair and misery and is now flipping back and fourth between the robotic, machine-like state he's left in emotionally after the end of the previous album and the broken down mentality he finds himself in at the beginning of <i>The Downward Spiral</i>. Through almost indistinguishable, fast paced, manic screams, he expresses feelings of not knowing where to go next. This song is about being at the very end of it before breaking down. There's nowhere left to go. You're at or almost beyond your limit and you have no idea what to do with yourself or how to deal with things anymore. This high-energy song kicks up the angst and anger up to the max to the point where the machine breaks and fizzles out at the end, essentially ending the original sound found on the band's first album and fully switching over to the organically raw, violent free fall that is <i>The Downward Spiral</i>.</p> 
        <h2>The Interconnected Albums Conspiracy</h2>
        <p>The fizzling out and of the sixth and final track on the EP ties it all together as a true transition between their first and second album. When I ordered this EP, I was hoping for some sort of bridge between the sounds of the first and second album. The overall style and composition of <i>The Downward Spiral</i> kind of came out of nowhere when you compare it to <i>Pretty Hate Machine</i>. I was surprised at how raw and unrefined their first album was compared to the second, having listened to the latter first. This album is exactly what I wanted, when I wanted it. I wanted something that sounded like those first two works combined. It could've been outtakes from <i>Pretty Hate Machine</i> or mixed samples of goats or something, but this delivered. I built up a completely unreasonable expectation for it and it was exactly what I wanted, when I wanted it. The first two albums don't make much sense together if you listen to them back-to-back, but if you put this between them, it provides a sense of continuity. “Ringfinger” transitions perfectly into "Pinion" and "Wish", while "Gave Up"transitions perfectly into "Mr. Self Destruct".  </p>
        <p><i>Broken</i> is a very experimental EP that Trent Reznor used as a sandbox to explore new sounds and techniques for creating music. It pushes the envelope of the Nine Inch Nails sound into new territories, and saw a level of polish and structure that hadn't been seen before. Through colossal, aggressive guitars and distorted vocals, this EP unleashes the bitterness, hate and anger you can tangibly feel in the passionate albeit subdued singing on <i>Pretty Hate Machine</i>. The EP is well mastered and has a surprisingly large dynamic range. Trent Reznor has always been conscious of the mastering of his music, and didn't let his works get butchered by the Loudness Wars until much later on into the 2010's on records such as <i>Hesitation Marks</i>. This allows you to listen to this EP over and over again while not getting fatigued. You have a chance to enjoy all the quiet bits as well as the loud bits at a high volume - all of which retain their detail. You can listen to this again and again and pick things out you didn't notice before. It flows like an album. It picks you up, throws you on a rollercoaster and begs you to take it for another spin as you're about to get off.</p>
        <h2>The Bonus Tracks</h2>
        <p>However, as Steve Jobs often said, "there's one more thing." <i>Broken</i> was originally distributed on a regular 4.75" disc with a 3".125 Mini CD packaged together with two bonus tracks. This is because Trent Reznor felt that these two extra tracks didn't fit the theme of the EP, as they were covers of other artists' songs. I understood this on a surface level at first, but I also believe this backs up my thinking that <i>Broken</i> serves as a bridge between <i>Pretty Hate Machine</i> and <i>The Downward Spiral</i>. That second disc was only present on the initial run of the EP, and due to the insistence of the record label, it was scrapped in favour of having all songs on one disc. Tracks 7 to 97 were filled by silence totaling to around a minute and thirty seconds between “Gave Up”, and “Physical”. This means that this later release of <i>Broken</i> is one of the few commercial releases (with real music on it, not one of those sound effects discs) that fills up all 99 available tracks in the Redbook Audio Standard for the Compact Disc - a fun little detail that CD nerds like me can appreciate.</p>
        <p>As the track counter on my CD player ticks up to 98, I'm greeted by a catchy, slower beat than anything prior. It's another great song that I enjoy a lot. I think that Nine Inch Nails is one of those bands that has such a unique sound and quality to them that they can cover any song and turn it into something new and enjoyable. Like Green Day, they have a very signature sound that they can apply to seemingly anything to make it their own. “Physical” feels like it lasts a long time compared to previous songs because if it's slower pace, and it sometimes feels like a detriment to the last song. For some reason, whenever I get to the last minute of “Physical” as it winds down, I think "well, that's too bad. It's the end of the EP now". Then, I realize that there's a whole other track. I enjoy “Suck”. It's another great cover filled with <i>Pretty Hate Machine</i> style bass lines, reverse cymbals and a copious amount of multitracking. </p>
        <h2>The Verdict</h2>
        <p>It's a lot of fun to listen to. It's easy to forget that I've only had this CD for 22 days at the time of writing, and I've listened to it so many times. There've been days where I've listened to this two or three times because I'm so addicted to it. There's not many albums that make me feel like this. Only a select few ever give this amount of pleasure.  From me, this is a solid five out of five stars.</p>
        <h2>My Copy</h2>
        <p>I bought this recently used off of Discogs. The disc itself is in spotless condition, and for a used Digipak, this one is looking great for it's age. For the past two years, I've felt the most excited to explore the discography of Nine Inch Nails more than any other band, and this release only injected more enthusiasm. I have a Canadian release of this album on CD with catalogue number 7 92213-2 on the spine. It comes in a very well made cardboard digipak with the aforementioned foldout panels. I'd say that this is probably the best made digipak I've ever come across; it's just ever so slightly thicker than any other I've seen thus far. Based on my knowledge of CD's and CINRAM's numbering codes, I reckon that while my disc's glass master was created on October 21st, 1992, there's no way for it to have been an original pressing due to the presence of an IFPI number. These were made mandatory sometime after 1994, and while IFPI 6000 does confirm the disc was pressed north of the 49th parallel, it doesn't give any more hints about the date. </p>
        <p>CINRAM's new logo isn't present on the disc, and the physical mould does line up with that 1992 release date, as it's the same as many other albums which came out at that time and were pressed here. I'd guess that this is CINRAM's "second generation" mould, though I haven't completely figured out all the different permutations of discs they've put out. I've seen a lot of them, but I haven't put that together yet. Either way, it's one of the later releases of this EP which has 91 tracks filled with blanks rather than the Broken EP plus a mini-disc of the latter two tracks. It smells moderately old; a bit musty, kind of like a book. Maybe this one was stored in more humid conditions by it's previous owner, or maybe old digipaks just smell like this since they're more like a book. It's probably from the late 1990's, or I know nothing and I'm completely misinterpreting all of this. It's great fun either way. </p>
