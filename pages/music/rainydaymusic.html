                <p>Imagine: you're in a coffee shop in the mid to late 90's and they're playing some pretty harmless, inoffensive music with a couple of sparse hits in between. Lots of Jangle-Pop and Power-Pop mixed in with the Grunge/Post-Grunge of the day. Sometimes they stand out, sometimes they're just filler</p>
                <p>This is one of my favourite playlists to have on in the rare occasion I'm not in the mood for a full album. I use the term "coffee shop rock" to describe the kind of inoffensive background music in between the hits.</p>

                                To me, R.E.M.’s <i>Automatic For The People</i> is the definitive rainy day album. Whenever it’s grey and wet outside, I’ll put this album on and it makes me feel things. I’ve always loved the rain and this album unlocks a feeling I just can’t get in any other situation. <br><br>
                                This album is deceptively labelled “Alternative Rock,” but I guess I wouldn’t really know what else to call it; It’s folk-y, it’s got full-on instrumentals and radio hits all in one. If you let it, this one will make you feel and send you on a journey. It begins with the kind of almost-tangible silence you can hear, and the first notes on the guitar feel like drops in a still pond. <br><br>
                                It’s the perfect soundtrack for a rainy day, and you’ll either end up grooving around in a really good mood, or you’ll want to jump in front of a bus: it’s a grey album steeped in misty rains and cloudy days. But don’t let the weather stop you from listening to it. Just sit back and enjoy—Kurt Cobain once said that he really liked this album and that he wanted Nirvana to go in this direction—but as we all know, we’ll never find out what that could’ve been. It’s the kind of rain-soaked duality Hemingway would have approved of—life and death, stillness and violence, all bound together in grey weather. <br><br>
                                My favourite tracks off this one are “Drive”, “Nightswimming”, “Man On The Moon”, “The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite” and “Monty Got A Raw Deal”.  <br><br>

                                I’ll admit it—<i>The Dark Side of The Moon</i> is my favourite album of all time so I’m insanely biased towards it. One of the things I love the most about it, though, is how universal it is. It’s an album about the human condition: life, death, love, loss, time, money and everything in between. <br><br>
                                On a rainy day, I think this album is perfect because it’ll put you in a contemplative mood. It’s an album you can really sit down and enjoy when you listen to it—one which somehow fits any mood or situation and acts as a perfect soundtrack. Watching the water stream down the window in a downpour while listening to the lyrics of “Time”, the rhythmic pitter-patter of raindrops matching up with “On The Run”, a thunderstorm intensifying as the crescendo of “Great Gig In The Sky” hits—it’s just unmatched! <br><br>
                                When I put this album on in the rain, it takes on a different meaning—just as it does in any other situation. Gilmour’s wailing guitars sound tired on a grey-washed melancholy day. Some of my favourite memories of listening to this album are sitting on a chair in front of an open window during a downpour and just feeling everything there is to feel. <br><br>
                                I’d recommend The Dark Side of the Moon in just about any situation—but in the rain, it feels like it was written for that exact moment.
