                <p>Here are a selection of albums I enjoyed a lot during the Summer of 2025. I worked an 8–5 desk job for the first time this summer, so I recorded a record number of listens to albums in these past three months. I'm very happy I got a chance to enjoy my CD's. Outside of work, I was out on my bike cycling all over the place enjoying albums on my iPod. It was a great time for music, as it always is!</p>

                                <i>Invisible Touch</i> was undoubtedly the album of the summer this year. According to my Music Statter program, I listened to it an unprecedented 53 times (that's counting my recorded listens on CD and my iPod), and I listened to the title track 96 times on my iPod individually. Seeing this album art will forever remind me of this summer, singing along to it while speeding around on my bike or enjoying the sunshine. I'm quite fond of this album. It's the most polished, streamlined and commercially successful Genesis album, and although some might bemoan the fact that they shifted to a more radio-friendly sound, I'll always be grateful for it.

                                In my journal, I've written many times now that it's been a "Phil Collins Summer"—he was involved in the majority of albums I've had spinning on repeat this summer. My second most-played album of the summer and one I have good memories listening to this season was his second solo effort. It's really catchy and fun despite the dark, angry and sometimes brooding lyrics. "I Cannot Believe It's True" is an earworm of the summer almost as much as "Invisible Touch". I just can't get enough of Collins' sound! I found this one at a thrift store in early July—I was already deep into Collins-era Genesis at that time, so it was a lot of fun to have come across it in the wild.

                                I got this album at a thrift store in October of 2024 and listened to it once, deciding that it wasn't the time for it. I had an urge to listen to it towards the end of spring while reading Larry Niven's <i>Ringworld</i>, and I was hooked on it afterwards. I love the vivid Peter Gabriel lyricism and just the way this album sounds—it's so much fun but in a completely different way than Genesis' later work. I remember sitting on a park bench with my book being blown away by this album early on, and listening to it on the bus while I was on my way to see a special screening of Pink Floyd's Pompeii in theatres. I'll also remember singing along to it later on in the summer once I memorized the lyrics as I rode across the city on my bike.

                                This is another album I listened to for the first time in late spring, but it really took off during the summer. It's infectiously fun and catchy. I enjoyed listening to it over and over again and memorizing the lyrics—this one-track album is the ultimate sing-along song once you get to know it. Ian Anderson's whimsically satirical lyrics make for great storytelling, and his flute solos are epic.

                                Coincidentally, I listened to <i>Meddle</i> at around the first time I listened to <i>Selling England By The Pound</i> for the first time, but I didn't listen to it again until the start of this summer. Leading up to the screening of Pompeii, I started listening to this album again and I really fell in love with it. Since then, I've listened to it a whopping twenty-five times over the past three months. I've enjoyed many sunsets listening to this paired with <i>Dire Straits/Brothers In Arms</i>. I absolutely love <i>Meddle</i>.

                                <i>Tunnel of Love</i> is a big departure from Sprinsteen's previous effort, <i>Born In The USA</i>. Shying away from the spotlight, he shifted away from recording with the bombastic, hit-making E-Street band and went largely solo. This album is introspective, quiet and vulnerable—all drenched in synths and classic Springsteen-storytelling. This summer, it was a really good album for slow afternoons, but especially twilight and after-dark. It felt good to play after twilight.

                                I tend to associate this album with Autumn because I was introduced to it almost a year ago in September of 2024, but it's stayed rather consistently in my listening rotation for the past year. It's so much fun to listen and sing along to—Billy Joel is an excellent songwriter and performer. I listened to this album quite a bit this summer, with "Big Shot" getting lots of individual plays on my iPod's Summer playlist. I would recommend <i>52nd Street</i> any day of the week!

                                This summer could be divided into two <i>Rush</i> albums: <i>Counterparts</i> and <i>Hold Your Fire</i>. This one was listened to a lot during the first half of the summer from June through mid-July. I had a great time walking around listening to this on the paths near campus. I read "Reconstruction" by Mick Herron becuase the spine of the book was the same colour as this album when I saw it at the library. Rush is awesome in any of their eras—this is much more of a transition back to pure hard rock compared to their slicker stuff from the 1980's. It's a damn good album!

                                <i>Hold Your Fire</i>: the second half of this summer's Rush equation. At the height of my enjoying <i>Counterparts</i>, I walked by the window of the library's bookstore to see this album, <i>Snakes & Arrows</i> and their self-titled debut sitting in the window. The next morning, I waited for the bookshop to open so that I could buy those three albums before anyone else did—that's the closest to a record launch I'll ever get in my generation, I suppose! I really love the sound of this album; like with all their music, it's got such an energy to it! <br><br>My most memorable moment with this album was when I listened to it during the latter half of my ascent up some local mountain-like hills. I cycled up 2,200ft and I felt so badass listening to this album—it's got to be one of the coolest things I've ever done, simply becuase I was listening to <i>Hold Your Fire</i>. But Rush is just that kind of band, isn't it?

                                Fragile is something I didn't listen to much in August (surprisingly), but it was played over and over again through the latter half of June into late July. This was the first time I've heard the really progressive rock side of Yes rather than their later progressive pop sound, and I really enjoyed it. The album is wonky, fun, spawling and a real experience to listen to.

                                Five years ago, I never would've believed that this album would make it on this kind of list, but here it is: <i>OU812</i>. Having enjoyed <i>Van Halen</i> and <i>1984</i>, I bought a copy of this album on the same day I found <i>The Dark Side of The Moon</i> at a thrift store. One of them became my most favourite album of all time, and the other became a black sheep. There was just something about this Van Hagar record which really didn't click with me. I listened to it a couple of times over the years and I just couldn't get into it—until this summer. Something happened and I understand it. I found myself singing along. I was enjoying it! I officially rescind any negative comments I've made about this album.

                                This album is a very recent addition to my collection, having come around in early August. I found a copy of it on CD at a thrift store—a first pressing RCA disc in a smooth jewel case from the Polydor plant in Germany. These CD's always sound absolutely spectacular, and this album is no exception. I've had a blast listening to this album over the past couple weeks, and it's become a part of the soundtrack of this summer.

                                I bought this album a couple of years ago but it never really clicked with me until early this summer. Back then, my mindset was "I know I'm going to like Genesis someday because I like Yes, Pink Floyd and King Crimson", so I ended up with copies of <i>Invisible Touch</i>, <i>We Can't Dance</i>, <i>Selling England By The Pound</i> and this one here. As I learned to love <i>Invisible Touch</i>, I naturally got into this album as well. So many good songs on this one! I just love Genesis. "Just a Job To Do", "Silver Rainbow", "That's All", "Taking It All To Hard", "Illegal Alien", "Home By The Sea" and "It's Gonna Get Better" were big standouts for me I enjoyed a lot. I've just named the entire album!

                                This last one is a bit of an interesting inclusion since I've only actually listened to it four times this summer. This sprawling triple-album isn't really one that you can listen to casually any day of the week—you've got to commit to it becuase it's so long. It's one I haven't been able to appreciate as much as I would have liked to because of the hugely diverse range of styles across this record. I have a huge amount of respect for The Clash becuase they're not afraid to experiment with other genres—I think that's their biggest strength. This summer, I've really learned to like this album. I've enjoyed it as a whole, and I've enjoyed the songs individually on playlists. <br><br>People don't really talk about this album when they talk about "challenging albums". I was able to get into <i>The Wall</i> and <i>In The Court of The Crimson King</i> very easily, but this one is definitely the hardest album to get into in my collection. I really like it, though. I'm glad that I'm on the way to appreciating it in the way I think it deserves to be appreciated.
