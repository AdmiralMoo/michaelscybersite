                    <p>This year—2025—marks fifteen years since the brief existence of Aero Ice Cream. I was young during this ephemeral slice of humanity's history, but I remember it well. It was the first flavour of ice cream I ever loved, based off what is to this day my favourite chocolate bar. I had only one tub of it before it disappeared off store shelves forever, but it left a lasting impact on me. That summer onwards, I looked to the freezer section for more, but it has never come back. I don't think it ever will.</p>
                    <p>There is now only one image on the entire internet which proves it ever existed. Upon discovering the other image—a product image on a warehouse site—disappeared, I've decided to save the only other image and keep it on this site. I just want there to be something on the internet to remind the world that such a thing did in fact exist. Kit Kat ice cream survives to this day and serves as a bitter reminder of what once was.</p>
                    <p>I'll never forget Aero ice cream, but the world will—it already has.</p>

                    <p>It wasn't until the summer of 2021 that I fell in love again. This time, it was Fudgsicle Ice Cream: an entire tub of real fudgsicle, just like it is on the stick. It was wonderful! I thought that I'd finally found something to make up for the loss of my beloved Aero ice cream.</p>
                    <p>For a time—a very short one—I did. But it alas, it was not meant to be.</p>
                    <p>Just like the first, I only had one tub of this ice cream before it was pulled from store shelves. I went back to the store less than a week later to find it out of stock, and it just never came back. It just wasn't meant to be.</p>

                    <p>In the past three years, however, I discovered Chapman's Premium Chocolate Fudge Brownie ice cream. For now, this long and winding story of ice cream disappointments has a happy ending; I've enjoyed dozens of tubs of this wonderful ice cream.</p>
                    <p>The thing I loved about this ice cream when I first tried it was that it reminded me of both Fudgicle ice cream and Aero ice cream. It's a perfect crossover between Aero ice cream and Fudgicle ice cream with little chocolate chunks in it. It's absolutely delicious!</p>
                    <p>I'm not all that into sweets and treats, so when I do find something I like, it's a big deal. It's a big deal that they took both Aero and Fudgicle ice cream away from me. Who knows how long Chocolate Fudge Brownie will be around? All this ice cream has been trying to teach me a lesson: you've got to appreciate what you have while you have it. As Tom Keifer of Cinderella once said, you "<i>don't know what you've got 'till it's gone</i>".</p>
