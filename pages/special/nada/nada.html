            <p>Do you sometimes see words when you think? If so, what font does it appear in? What do they look like?</p>

            <p>Most of the time, my inner monologue is intangible—it exists without any visual cues or subvocalization. Thoughts, concepts, and emotions are just <i>feelings</i> in a way I can't quite describe. A good amount of the time, I can't picture things in my head; I have to be in an intense focus while reading a book for visions of far-off lands to dance across my vision. </p>
            
            
            <p>From time to time, thoughts—special thoughts, I suppose—come in the form of words. I see them as if they were words printed on a page or a sign, for the most part, in the same few fonts. That's what I want to explore and try to represent on this webpage.</p>

            <p>One of my all time favourite fonts is <i>Helvetica</i>. Some might call it boring, but I think it's beautiful. You can use it anywhere, really. Jam Jar? Helvetica. Dentist's Office? Helvetica. Expense report? Helvetica. Tombstone? Helvetica!</p>

            <p>Thoughts in Helvetica are usually seen in <i>Helvetica Bold</i>—a nice, strong flavour of the tasteful font. Usually, these are short spats of thought, imagined as if they were printed words. They're not perfect like when <i>Garamond</i> appears; they're slightly bloated like ink stamped onto a page, sometimes a bit disheveled—not every print is perfect, after all—and sometimes, they look absolutely filthy. </p>

            <p>Sometimes, I don't know if my thoguhts are appearing in <i>Helvetica</i>, or <i>Akzidenz-Grostek</i>—the latter of which is a lot of fun to say once you've practiced a little bit. </p>

            <p>They're very similar, but they convey different feelings. <i>Helvetica</i> is technically perfect, while <i>Akzidenz-Grostek</i> is a more free-flowing font, if you could apply those words to a formal-looking sans-serif. One of the biggest differences to me is that the latter's letters often terminate on a diagonal, while the former's are straight and streamlined. Some thoughts just work better in one than the other, and they feel different.</p>

            Helvetica looks uncanny when you write it in it's German contemporary

            Nine Inch Nails used Akzidenz-Grostek for <i>Broken (1992)</i> and <i>Fixed (1992)</i>

            <p>Finally, we have <i>Garamond</i>—an ancient font family with many subspecies. In my digital journal, I use <i>Adobe Garamond Pro</i> or <i>EB Garamond Medium</i>—I've chosen the former for representation since it looks great on screens.</p>

            <div class="gridgridbox">
                <img src="/pages/special/nada/garamond_std.png">

                <img src="/pages/special/nada/garamond_ita.png">
            </div>

            <p>I would say that the grand majority of the thoughts I have warrant use of Garamond. They just look best in Garamond, whether they're long, winding writings or short, silly spats of thought. Although my handwriting is dense and almost like cursive, I imagine them in something akin to <i>Garamond Medium Italic</i> when read or thought of, if this makes any sense. </p>

            <div class="gridgridbox">
                <img src="/pages/special/nada/garamond_lookatmenow.png">
                <img src="/pages/special/nada/garamond_mcchicken.png">
            </div>

            <p>Oddly enough, Garamond almost never comes about in just plain text; it's pretty much always italic. I can't remember a single instance when it wasn't italic. I can't seem to picture most other fonts in my head, either. I know what they look like, but it's more akin to recalling a memory rather than conjuring entirely new shapes from the black void of imagination; I seem to have the entire typeface backed up somewhere in there.</p>

            </div>

            <p>When I think about what I'm about to do, I oftentimes make a plan. It's not just <i>a</i>, but <i>The Plan</i>—something grandiose, exciting and special; something I want to execute. That always comes out in Garamond, and the vision of it excites and motivates me.</p>

            <div class="gridgridbox">

            </div>

            <p>Another thing I really like about Garamond is the way that roman numerals look. They're instrumental to <i>THE PLAN</i>, and instrumental to making most anything look cool in a numbered list. I love that Led Zeppelin used roman numerals for their first three (and fourth, unofficially) albums. My favourite numeral is <i>IV</i>, but <i>III</i>, <i>II</i> and <i>I</i> are close runners up.</p>

            <i><p>You see so many things: confidence on display, and displays of confidence a lack thereof; straightwalkers, slouchwalkers, sleepwalkers, slowalkers, fastwalkers; those waiting for the arrival of friends—some who remained faithful and rejoined their comrades, others who abandoned their post; observers, as I said—four of them without including me; a thoughtful Frederick, deep in thought, plodding along steadily towards an unkown destination; greycoats, redcoats, bluecoats—browncoats the most popular, so it seems.</p></i>
