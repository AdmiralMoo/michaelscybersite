                    <h3>The Claim</h3>
                    <p>I've always been skeptical when I heard of songs syncing up with movies. Despite <i>The Dark Side of The Moon</i> being my all-time favourite album, I've never watched <i>The Dark Side of The Rainbow</i>—the supposed alignment of that album with <i>The Wizard of Oz (1939)</i>.</p>
                    <p>However, I recently came across a post which claimed Pink Floyd's <i>Echoes</i> syncs up perfectly with the "JUPITER AND BEYOND THE INFINITE" arc of <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i>. Intrigued, I decided to give this a shot.</p>
                    <p>I watched <i>2001</i> for the first time when I was young and I was both confused and blown away by it. I've seen it at least seven or eight times since then, mostly on VHS with at least two viewings on DVD. I recently got a copy of the new 4k Blu-Ray remaster, so I've been looking forward to watching it again in high fidelity.</p>
                    <p>As for "Echoes", I'm just a huge Pink Floyd fan. <i>Meddle</i> has been one of my most-listened albums this year, so it just happens that I've been enjoying "Echoes" quite a bit recently.</p>
                    <h3>The Setup</h3>
                    <p>I connected my WH-1000XM3's to the Sony Bravia TV via Bluetooth and put the disc in the player. I flipped through all the settings and made sure Dolby Atmos was at least giving some sort of snake-oil impression before starting.</p>
                    <p>It's a very different experience than just popping a tape in the player and letting it run, but the joys of watching a movie from one's shelf remains the same.</p>
                    <h3>The Experience</h3>
                    <p>Needless to say, <i>2001</i> looked and sounded absolutely stunning. My mind was beyond blown and I so thoroughly enjoyed this—it was like watching it for the first time again. The scale of the film really comes across with this new scan and restoration; this movie was really made for the big screen, so any extra pixels you can get will reveal tons of tiny details.</p>
                    <p>I love that <i>2001</i> opens itself to so much interpretation every time you watch it. The movie invites you to figure out what's going on and dive deep into philosophical ponderings, or you can just feast on the beautiful sets and cinematography.</p>
                    <p>The music of <i>Space Odyssey</i> is it's own whole thing for me: I love Strauss—both of them. Richard Strauss' tone poems, including <i>Also Sprach Zarathustra</i> is one of my all time favourite classical compositions. I was fortunate enough to have the chance to see it live twice a couple of months ago, and it was one of the most brilliant experiences I've had in a concert hall. The waltzes of Johann Strauss II have soundtracked many of my college days—"An Der Schonen, Blauen Donau" in particular is one I've listened to many a time while walking the halls, imagining I'm on my own little odyssey.</p>
                    <h3>The Sync</h3>
                    <p>Finally, HAL sang Daisy and it was time for <i>JUPITER AND BEYOND THE INFINITE</i>. I put on my AirPods Pro on underneath my WH-1000XM3's and set them to "transparency" mode, hitting play on the Blu-Ray player and "Echoes" on my phone at the same time. The song was an ALAC ripped from my CD copy of the album.</p>
                    <p>Almost right away, I noticed things start to sync up; cameras cut to the beat and "Echoes" swelled into existence as the camera panned around Jupiter and the Monolith.</p>
                    <p>I was really blown away when the journey beyond infinity started and the song moved into the next part. Every single part of BEYOND THE INFINITE lined up with a part of Echoes! I was completely skeptic going into it and ready to be disappointed, but I was completely blown away. I can't express how cool this was, especially having loved the movie and the music for a long time. <i>2001</i> and <i>Pink Floyd</i> fit together so perfectly!</p>
                    <p>It's unbelievable that things line up so perfectly; I thought I was going to run out of time at the end, but the song ended the moment the credits began, and I was once again treated to <i>An Der Schonen, Blauen Donau</i>. I would highly recommend this! It makes a masterpiece of a movie even better.</p>
