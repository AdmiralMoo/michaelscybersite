                                My name is Michael, and I'm a college student studying Game Development in Canada. I've been messing about with computers since I was two years old, and for as long as I can remember, investigating technologies has been one of my greatest interests. Whether it's new or old, playing around with something I've never seen before and understanding how it works is always fun. I'm an avid listener of music and I enjoy an ever expanding variety of sounds, but my interests are mainly rooted in Grunge and Progressive Rock. I listen to all my music on CD or the digital rips of my CD's on my iPod. I really enjoy everything about the format, including organizing and cataloguing my library. In addition, I also have a small collection of cassette tapes, DVD's, Blu-Ray's and VHS tapes. 
                                <br><br>
                                Since my Dad passed his Nikon D40 down to me in 2018, I've been regularly photographing the world around me. I've taken over 180,000 photographs as of October 2024 and I'm waiting to see how far I can push this camera before it dies and I have to replace it. I really enjoy getting the most out of simple hardware and using dedicated devices; I strongly believe that today's tech tries to do too much more than what it's supposed to do. Another passion introduced to me by my Dad is cycling; I try to ride my bike - a 2023 Kona Rove AL-700 - as often as possible. When it's warm enough, I use it to commute to work and school. I think a bike and camera are the perfect companions on an adventure into the unknown. 
                                <br><br>
                                I started programming in 2015 when I taught myself Python 2.7, and I regularly use Python 3.x as my every-day "fun" language for messing around and developing utilities. I also know C#, C++, Visual Basic and I'm teaching myself HTML and CSS through the construction of this website. I enjoy making 3D models using Blender from time to time, as well as doing special effects editing in Adobe After Effects; the latter of which I haven't done much of since 2020. I have a couple of old computers including an IBM ThinkCentre 8183, an IBM ThinkPad x201 and a Windows XP-era gaming computer I've built up over the years to enjoy my childhood games and era-appropriate software. 
                                <br><br>
                                I play a lot of sandbox and simulation games, a good chunk of which I've been enjoying since I was young. SimCity 4, Zoo Tycoon 2 and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004 are a trio that have been with me for as long as I can remember, and they're some of my all time favourites. I'm very fond of the PlayStation 2 and games such as Gran Turismo 3, ATV Offroad Fury 2 and MVP Baseball 2005 amongst many others. Recently, in terms of modern games, I've been playing primarily sim racing titles such as Automobilista 2 and Assetto Corsa. 
                                <br><br>
                                My favourite movie is <i>The Terminator (1984)</i>, while <i>Star Wars (1977)</i> and <i>Jurassic Park (1993)</i> follow closely behind. <i>Independence Day (1996)</i>, <i>2001: A Space Odyssyey (1968)</i>, <i>Top Gun (1986)</i> and <i>The Transformers Movie (1986)</i> make it into the Top 10. My favourite TV show (at least the one I'm most fond of) is probably <i>Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001)</i> or <i>The Transformers (1984-1987)</i>. BBC's <i>Walking With Dinosaurs (1999)</i> is hands down my all time favourite documentary. I can't yet figure out what my favourite book is, but <i>Duma Key</i> by Stephen King has stuck vividly in my mind since I first read it over a decade ago. My favourite fonts are Helvetica, Roboto and Quartz.
                                <br><br>
                                I've had an interest in racing for as long as I can remember, and I follow Formula 1 closely along with WEC and IMSA. I've always really liked airplanes - I wanted to be some sort of pilot when I was younger - and my favourite airplane is the North American XB-70 Valkyrie. If I could own any plane, it would be a Douglas DC-3. I've also always loved the BAC/Aerospatiale Concorde and the Boeing 747-400. The Avro CF-104 Arrow is really cool, as is the Consolidated PBY Catalina, CF-101 Voodoo and the Boeing 737-700. I really like that the latter is a very small big plane. If I could drive any car, it would be a Porsche 991.2 911 GT3 R. I've always really liked the Toyota GT-One, Corvette C5-R and the Dodge Viper amongst others, but in terms of cars that are still racing, I'm a big fan of the Porsche 963, Ferrari 499p, Porsche 992 911 GT3.R, Ferrari 296 GT3 and the Oreca 07 LMP2. Modern F1 cars are kind of fat.
                                <br><br>
                                I'm quiet and I keep to myself most of the time, but I enjoy making people laugh. I value the few close relationships I have rather than talking to a lot of people and trying to know everyone. The grand majority of the time, I'm very happy spending time alone. As Friedrich Nietzsche said, "I hate who steals my solitude without, in exchange, offering me true company". I do a lot of thinking. That thinking is often accompanied by writing. My favourite colours are green and purple. In short, I'm a huge nerd with lots of hobbies to keep me busy.

                            <p>
                                As I said, this site is a fun little side project so that I can learn HTML and CSS; something i've wanted to do for a while. I don't particularly like the direction which the internet has gone in the past 15 years, and I think that it does more harm than good nowadays. So, instead of hating it and being bitter, I'm making this site to host my passions and interests just like the sites I came across browsing the web as a kid in the mid to late 2000's. I want this to be my own little corner of the internet, just as I've always wanted. I don't really expect anyone to see this and I would be surprised if it came up at all in any kind of Google search. Either way, it doesn't really matter. 
                                <br><br>
                                Although I tried to build the original incarnation of this site from September of 2024 using a website-builder called OpenElement, I quickly learned why people don't recommend such tools. At the beginning of October, I started from scratch in Visual Studio Code and built the whole thing from the ground up by myself. It ain't much, but it's honest work and I'm really proud of it. It'll continue to evolve over time as I better understand how the language works and how it can be applied in cooler ways.

                                I don't really have a name for this guy yet, but I often call it "The Typewriter". I rescued this ThinkPad from the trash in early 2024 and it's helped remind me why I loved computers in the first place. It's very simple and runs Windows 7, so it's without any of the internet-driven frustrations my modern computers cause. I have a Debian Linux dual boot as well if I want to watch YouTube or do some browsing. I love this thing so much becuase it has a physical internet switch, which I have turned off most of the time other than to sync my OneNote notebook. I recently thrifted an Ultrabase x200 for it over the summer - an addon which latches on using the docking port underneath and adds more USB ports and a CD/DVD drive. This laptop also fulfills a bucket-list dream of using a laptop that has a fingerprint reader. What a nifty thing this is!

I stuck a 2TB hard drive in it, and now it's used as a Jellyfin media server to host rips of my DVD's, Blu-Rays and CD's for me and my family to access. It's also what I use to sync my iPod.

                                I'm in the process of building an all-Sony Hi-Fi stack, something i've wanted for a really long time. I started off with all-in-one micro Hi-Fi's like the Sony MHC-GX99 and the Sony CMT-HPX9, but I wore out the CD drives on those quickly and they conked out. I wanted <i>real</i> Hi-Fi, so I started getting components for cheap at thrift stores as I find them earlier in 2024. Eventually, I'd like to acquire a tape deck and an individual CD player to go along with what I already have.

                                This is the player I use every day to listen to music since I got rid of streaming services in January of 2024. I'd always wanted an iPod Classic growing up despite only really knowing the iPod Touch/iPhone era, and after I decided that the expandable storage of an iPod is the only logical next step for me, I bought a broken one off eBay and fixed it up. I replaced the battery, the front and back cover, the headphone jack and the display. I converted it to a fat-backed model and eventually put in a 3200mah battery which I've never had die on me in the six or seven months I've had it installed at the time of writing. I really love this thing. It hasn't been in my life for long, but I'm already very fond of it and the experiences it's made possible. Along with my Sony WH-1000XM3's, this is unquestionably one of my best purchases. Together, they're a godly powerful pair which delivers nothing but pure happiness.

                                I got this iPod for christmas in 2015 to replace my Dad's old iPod Touch (1st Gen) I was using to listen to music in my day-to-day life. I used this thing every day for a couple of years until I got a phone, and then I continued using it becuase that phone was a crappy no-name Android and I hated all the music players available for it. I only really stopped when I saved up and bought an iPhone 12 Mini in 2021. The 64GB of the iPhone was a huge upgrade over the iPod, and becuase I had the same music app at my disposal, I didn't really need this anymore. It's served me well, and the battery life is pretty much nonexistent nowadays.

                                In the holiday sesason of 2007, becuase the team my Dad led exceeded their targets, his company gifted him a shiny, engraved iPod Touch. This is that iPod. It replaced his Samsung YP-K3, which was later passed on to me. This was eventually passed down to me after I did my time with the YP-K3 and I used it as my everyday player from around 2014 to the end of 2015 when I got my 6th Generation iPod Touch. I actually ended up using this again sporadically as the battery of my newer iPod Touch gave way, and it was the test vehicle I used to see if I could transition from streaming to an iPod full time when I started the experiment in November of 2023. I enjoyed it so much that I barely touched Apple Music at all in December, and by January, my subscription was gone. Somehow, the battery has held up all these years and it holds a charge for a day and a half with moderate use.

                                This was my first MP3 player; a 2GB device which mimicked the overall layout of the 3rd Generation iPod Nano. It came with the expected music playback functionality, a fully adjustable equalizer, a builtin AM/FM Radio tuner and even the ability to store and view images. Oddly, it couldn't display album art. The music on this thing sounded really bad becuase there was so little storage, and I knew that even back in 2012 when I was using it. I'm greatful that I can carry around 400+ lossless CD quality albums in my pocket with my iPod Classic. It's amazing that these two devices existed at the same time, despite the iPod needing 3rd party upgrades to reach it's full potential. Unfortunately, this old player's screen started to die in around 2017, and it's almost completely illegible now. All that's left are a bunch of vertical orange bars. It's truly become e-waste, with no avenues to fix or replace the component.

                                As previously mentioned, my Dad gave me his Nikon D40, and that's the only DSLR I've ever owned and used regularly. He grew up with a Canon AE-1, so he wanted to switch back to that more familiar brand after buying Nikon in the early 2000's when it was cheaper. The only lens that I've ever bought is the Sigma Super Telephoto lens, which I got used in the Summer of 2023 to shoot air-shows, motor races and birds. The other two are the kit lens which came with the camera, and the zoom lens my Dad bought before going to the 2008 Hungarian Grand Prix. I've had this camera since September of 2018. As of the time of writing, it's at 194,432 shutter actuations: 389% of it's expected shutter life. I often wonder if this is the most used Nikon D40 out there.

                                This film camera was won in an auction by my ex-girlfriend's mother, and was given to me as a gift. We were together for quite a while and her family was really good to me. Unfortunately, i've never used this camera becuase film is really freaking expensive all of a sudden. I remember it being dirt cheap a couple of years ago and wishing I had a film camera, and now that I finally have one, I can't justify the price! It came with a beautiful piece of glass which I often use with my D40 since it all uses the same F mount.

                                I've had this little point-and-shoot digital camera since 2012 when my Dad bought it for me for christmas. I've started using it regularly again since 2020, as I quite enjoy it's simplicity and somewhat nostalgic image quality. It's just another single-use device I enjoy having around.
