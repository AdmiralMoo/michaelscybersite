                        I started this site in September of 2024 to learn CSS and HTML. I've been interested in making my own website since I played around with the web builder in Microsoft Publisher 2003, but I haven't gotten around to learning it for real until now.

                    <p>
                        I'm trying to grow this into a platform where I can show off my creations, store my lists and compendiums. I'm very passionate about the things I'm interested in, so this is a great way to indulge those interests further.

                    <h4><i>Me</i></h4>
                    <p>
                        My name is Michael, and I'm a college student studying programming in Canada. Most of the time, you'll find me listening to music or quoting <i>The Terminator</i> in an Austrian accent. I enjoy learning about things and messing around with them. I read books, on occasion, and I take photos sometimes too; those things have their own page on this site, so I won't say much more about them. 
                    </p>
                    <h4><i>Cycling</i></h4>
                    <p>
                        When it's above eight degrees, I enjoy cycling; when it's not, I think about cycling. It's a vicious cycle, really. 
                    </p>
                    <h4><i>Computer-Based Activities</i></h4>
                    <p>
                        On the computer, I do a lot of programming in Python and C#, though I also know C++, Visual Basic, a bit of JavaScript and—hence the website you're reading this on—I'm learning HTML and CSS. I've done a lot of 3D Modelling in Blender, a fair bit of special-effects and video editing in Adobe After Effects and Premiere Pro, and some audio editing in Adobe Audition; I've picked up all sorts of skills getting into things here and there. 
                    </p>
                    <h4><i>Games</i></h4>
                    <p>
                        I used to play a lot of games, but not so much anymore. On the computer, my all-time favourite games have always been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity_4"><i>SimCity 4 (2003)</i></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo_Tycoon_2"><i>Zoo Tycoon 2 (2004)</i></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_2004:_A_Century_of_Flight"><i>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004</i></a>, and I still play a lot of those. In terms of modern games, I've played a decent amount of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobilista_2"><i>Automobilista 2 (2020)</i></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assetto_Corsa"><i>Assetto Corsa (2014)</i></a>. The only console I really play is the PlayStation 2; <a href=""><i>MVP Baseball 2005 (2005)</i></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gran_Turismo_3:_A-Spec"><i>Gran Turismo 3 (2001)</i></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATV_Offroad_Fury_2"><i>ATV Offroad Fury 2 (2002)</i></a> are the games I play most often on there. 
                    </p>
                    <h4><i>Movies</i></h4>
                    <p>
                        My favourite movie is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Terminator"><i>The Terminator (1984)</i></a>, while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_(film)"><i>Star Wars (1977)</i></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park_(film)"><i>Jurassic Park (1993)</i></a> follow closely behind. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(1996_film)"><i>Independence Day (1996)</i></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey"><i>2001: A Space Odyssyey (1968)</i></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Gun"><i>Top Gun (1986)</i></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outlaw_Josey_Wales"><i>The Outlaw Josey Wales (1971)</i></a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Transformers:_The_Movie"><i>The Transformers Movie (1986)</i></a> make it into the Top 10.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I don't watch movies very often, but when I do, it's usually <i>The Terminator</i>.
                    </p>
                    <h4><i>TV Shows</i></h4>
                    <p>
                        I've watched a lot of Star Trek—the entirety of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series"><i>TOS</i></a> (three times), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation"><i>TNG</i></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Voyager"><i>Voyager</i></a> (twice), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine"><i>DS9</i></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Enterprise"><i>Enterprise</i></a>. It sounds ridiculous that I've watched <i>TOS</i> thrice, but I was introduced to it by my dad—as with a lot of my interests—when I was very young, so I've had time. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other than that, I'm a big fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Transformers_(TV_series)"><i>The Transformers (1984-1987)</i></a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I don't watch much TV anymore, really. I guess that goes for all my screen-based hobbies: I don't do much of them anymore unless I'm creating something.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        BBC's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking_with_Dinosaurs"><i>Walking With Dinosaurs (1999)</i></a> is hands down my all time favourite documentary.
                    </p>
                    <h4><i>Racing</i></h4>
                    <p>
                        What I do watch a lot of is racing: I've been a fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One">Formula 1</a> for quite some time, but my real interest is sporstscar endurance racing in series such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMSA_SportsCar_Championship">IMSA</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIA_World_Endurance_Championship">WEC</a>. Watching cars go in circles for twelve hours is a truly wonderful thing.

                        I like computer hardware. I've got lots of old parts laying around, and I sometimes throw together a computer and install an operating system for fun. Some people bring home stray dogs they found on the side of the road; I bring home stray computers I found on the side of the road. "A Rescue", you could call some of them.

                    <p>
                        An old work computer saved from the dumpster 2019. Since then, I've upgraded it so that I can enjoy my childhood games from the Windows XP era. I use it for writing since Word 2003 and Windows XP is devoid of AI and other distractions. I named it after the family computer that introduced me to the world of computing: an HP Pavilion 4445 I called Big Beige.

                    <p>
                        I rescued this ThinkPad from the trash in early 2024 and it reminds me why I loved computers in the first place. It's very simple and runs Windows 7, so it's without any of the internet-driven frustrations my modern computers cause. It's got ports out the wazoo, and with the Ultrabase x200, it does everything I need.

                    <p>
                        This is a retired high-school computer I took home when my computer science teacher deliberately averted his eyes. I stuck a 2TB hard drive in it, and now it's used as a Jellyfin media server to host rips of my DVD's, Blu-Rays and CD's for me and my family to access. It's also what I use to sync my iPod.
