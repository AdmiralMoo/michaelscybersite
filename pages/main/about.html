                        I started this site in September of 2024 to learn CSS and HTML. I've been interested in making my own website since I played around with the web builder in Microsoft Publisher 2003, but I haven't gotten around to learning it for real until now. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm trying to grow this into a platform where I can show off my creations, store my lists and compendiums. I'm very passionate about the things I'm interested in, so this is a great way to indulge those interests further. This is the ultimate ongoing project!

                    <p>
                        My name is Michael, and I'm a college student studying programming in Canada. Most of the time, you'll find me listening to music or quoting <i>The Terminator</i> in an Austrian accent. I enjoy learning about things and messing around with them. I read books, on occasion, and I take photos sometimes too; those things have their own page on this site, so I won't say much more about them. 
                    </p>
                    <h4><i>Cycling</i></h4>
                    <p>
                        When it's above eight degrees, I enjoy cycling; when it's not, I think about cycling. It's a vicious cycle, really.

                    <h4><i>Computer-Based Activities</i></h4>
                    <p>
                        On the computer, I do a lot of programming in Python and C#, though I also know C++, Visual Basic, a bit of JavaScript and—hence the website you're reading this on—I'm learning HTML and CSS. I've done a lot of 3D Modelling in Blender, a fair bit of special-effects and video editing in Adobe After Effects and Premiere Pro, and some audio editing in Adobe Audition; I've picked up all sorts of skills getting into things here and there. 
                    </p>
                    <h4><i>Games</i></h4>
                    <p>
                        I used to play a lot of games, but not so much anymore. On the computer, my all-time favourite games have always been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity_4"><i>SimCity 4 (2003)</i></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo_Tycoon_2"><i>Zoo Tycoon 2 (2004)</i></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_2004:_A_Century_of_Flight"><i>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004</i></a>, and I still play a lot of those. In terms of modern games, I've played a decent amount of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobilista_2"><i>Automobilista 2 (2020)</i></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assetto_Corsa"><i>Assetto Corsa (2014)</i></a>. The only console I really play is the PlayStation 2: <a href=""><i>MVP Baseball 2005 (2005)</i></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gran_Turismo_3:_A-Spec"><i>Gran Turismo 3 (2001)</i></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATV_Offroad_Fury_2"><i>ATV Offroad Fury 2 (2002)</i></a> are the games I play most often on there. 
                    </p>
                    <h4><i>TV Shows</i></h4>
                    <p>
                        I've watched a lot of Star Trek—the entirety of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series"><i>TOS</i></a> (three times), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation"><i>TNG</i></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Voyager"><i>Voyager</i></a> (twice), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine"><i>DS9</i></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Enterprise"><i>Enterprise</i></a>. It sounds ridiculous that I've watched <i>TOS</i> thrice, but I was introduced to it by my dad—as with a lot of my interests—when I was very young, so I've had time. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other than that, I'm a big fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Transformers_(TV_series)"><i>The Transformers (1984-1987)</i></a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I don't watch much TV anymore, really. I guess that goes for all my screen-based hobbies: I don't do much of them anymore unless I'm creating something.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        BBC's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking_with_Dinosaurs"><i>Walking With Dinosaurs (1999)</i></a> is hands down my all time favourite documentary.
                    </p>
                    <h4><i>Racing</i></h4>
                    <p>
                        What I do watch a lot of is racing: I've been a fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One">Formula 1</a> for quite some time, but my real interest is sporstscar endurance racing in series such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMSA_SportsCar_Championship">IMSA</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIA_World_Endurance_Championship">WEC</a>.

                        I like computer hardware. I've got lots of old parts laying around, and I sometimes throw together a computer and install an operating system for fun. Some people bring home stray dogs they found on the side of the road; I bring home stray computers I found on the side of the road. "A Rescue", you could call some of them.

                        An old work computer saved from the dumpster 2019. Since then, I've upgraded it so that I can enjoy my childhood games from the Windows XP era. I use it for writing since Word 2003 and Windows XP is devoid of AI and other distractions. I named it after the family computer that introduced me to the world of computing: an HP Pavilion 4445 I called Big Beige.

                    <p>
                        I rescued this ThinkPad from the trash in early 2024 and it reminds me why I loved computers in the first place. It's very simple and runs Windows 7, so it's without any of the internet-driven frustrations my modern computers cause. It's got ports out the wazoo, and with the Ultrabase x200, it does everything I need.

                        This is a retired high-school computer I took home when my computer science teacher deliberately averted his eyes. I stuck a 2TB hard drive in it, and now it's used as a Jellyfin media server to host rips of my DVD's, Blu-Rays and CD's for me and my family to access. It's also what I use to sync my iPod.

                            My first videogame console I ever played and owned. The PlayStation 2 is my favourite console of all time, and I continue to play it semi-regularly to this day. <br>
                            I play PS1 games on my PlayStation 2, and I have a 64MB Free McBoot memory card so that I can transfer saves to my computer and PCSX2.

                            Still the coolest handheld to this day! I love my PSP and I still bring it around with me on occasion when I don't feel like bringing a book. <br>
                            I've got a CFW setup that's been going since around 2014, transferred between various memory cards. Right now, I've got a 256GB Micro SD in a Memory Stick adapter.

                        <p>
                            I had a lot of fun with the Wii playing Sports Resort and SimCity Creator. I didn't use it for some time, but it saw a renaissance during the pandemic when I modded it. The poor thing has fallen into disuse once more.<br>
                            I never really felt like there were a lot of good games for the Wii. I enjoyed the ones I enjoyed, and I tried quite a few from the library, but it just didn't feel like there was as much there. Meanwhile, I feel like I might not be able to stop if I were to continue naming fun PS2 games.

                    <h4>Nintendo 3DS</h4>
                        <p>
                            <b>Year: </b>2013<br>
                            <b>Model: </b> XL (Blue)<br>
                            <b>Top Three Games:</b> Pokemon Omega Ruby, Pokemon X, Pokemon HeartGold<br>
                            <b>Other Favourites:</b> Super Scribblenauts, Pilotwings Resort, Zoo Tycoon 2 DS
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I had a PSP, and everyone else seemed to have a DS. I wanted to play Pokemon, so I got one of these. I've always regretted getting the XL instead of the standard sized 3DS. <br>
                            This console definitely doesn't have the longevity, power or appeal of the PSP, but I enjoyed it for a time in the early 2010's. Omega Ruby was the peak of my 3DS enjoyment—I got it on launch day and beat it in a week. What a time!

                        <p>
                            The PS3 was an awesome console and I enjoyed the heck out of it. This was my cousin's PS3—he gave me the console and a whole bunch of games when the PS4 launched. He got me into videogames and PlayStation as a whole.<br>
                            In the past five years, I've only really revisited Skate and Gran Turismo 6. It was a formidable console for its time.

                    <h4>Sony PlayStation Vita</h4>
                        <p>

                        <p>
                            The Vita is an odd little thing. It's by far the most advanced and jam-packed portable console ever released, but it's lacking in games. It feels like it just never really got started.<br>
                            My cousin gave me his Vita because he didn't really use it much. I mostly use it for emulation and watching movies on the go.

                        <p>
                            My cousin gave me his PS4 shortly after the launch of the PS5. I played with it a little, but I couldn't really enjoy it due to the always-online requirements for license verification and the bad internet I had where I lived at the time. I wanted to play The Last of Us Part II, but I had really bad motion sickness and it just didn't work out.<br>
                            Unfortunately, this console sat dormant for a while until early September of 2025, when I took it out and started playing MLB The Show 2024 on it. I've enjoyed it a lot since!

                            In mid-October of 2025, my best friend bought a PlayStation 5 Pro, and he traded me his base-model PlayStation 5 for a ring light I had laying around.<br>
                            This is the first time I've got a current-gen console and I'm enjoying it a lot. I'm looking forwards to lots of great memories with this thing.

                    <p>I watch a lot of racing! Watching people drive fast cars in overcomplicated circles for 12 hours sounds like a good time to me.</p>
                    <h3>IMSA & WEC</h3>
                    <p>I've always been fascinated by the spaceships of La Sarthe playing Gran Turismo 3 and 4 as a kid. Sportscar endurance racing—specifically IMSA—is my favourite thing to watch. I've been to a couple of IMSA races and it's the most exhilirating thing!</p>
                    <p>I would love to go to Le Mans someday—that would be my dream race. Seeing Ferrari return to the top class of motor racing and win Le Mans three consecutive years in a row has been one of the most special things I've seen in sport. Every IMSA or WEC race is packed with nonstop action and fairy-tale-like stories are written. To me, this is the ultimate form of motorsport—where drivers of all disciplines come together to duke it out on an even playing field.</p>

                    <h3>Formula 1</h3>
                    <p>My Dad has always liked Ferrari, and so have I. Schumacher was everywhere when I was younger—in movies, books, a photo on the wall of the kindergarten classroom. Alonso's golden years at Ferrari in the early 2010's was the first time I was really into F1. There was a lull in the late 2010's for me, but I came back to it not too long after. I watch every competitive session every weekend these days</p>
                    <p>My favourite team is Ferrari, though above any team is Fernando Alonso—I will cheer for whatever team he drives for in any sport. Oscar Piastri has been a favourite recently as well—I thought he was awesome in F2, and I'm so impressed by him in F1 thus far. I'm hoping for a World Championship this year!</p>

                        <p>Along with racing, I also enjoy watching some baseball from time to time.</p>
                        <p>I've always been a Blue Jays fan. I have very fond memories of going to the super-cheap games sitting up in the 500's level at the Rogers Centre in the late 2000's and early 2010's. I've been to quite a few games, though I've regrettably not seen one in a couple of years since I moved away.</p>
                        <p>Growing up, my favourite player was Roy Halladay—it was just amazing watching him on the mound! I was sad when he got traded, but he went on to even greater things. One of my favourite memories was when he made his first start in Toronto since the trade, and he received a standing ovation; we all clapped because he was Roy Halladay.</p>
                        <p>Jose Bautista was an amazing story, too: an underdog who had a breakout season relatively late in his career, propelling him to stardom. It was so cool watching him hit and run the bases, and it still feels weird not having him guarding right field. Did you know that Bautista owns (owned?) a Booster Juice in downtown Toronto?</p>
                        <p>The current Blue Jays team is very exciting and I'm hoping they'll do something with the 2025 post-season.</p>
