The music is larger than life and the vocals are epic. The second side is more conventional Rush, and it's awesome too. '2112' and 'Lessons' are my favourite tracks. ",

They're the same kinds of people who crap on Green Day's <i>Warning</i>, argue that The Clash isn't punk, Alice In Chains shouldn't have continued and Prog bands all committed treason in the 1980s: they're missing out on the good things in life. <br><br>The aforementioned Nine Inch Nails releases are undoubtedly Nine Inch Nails—they ooze the craftsmanship and quality of Trent Reznor's work, and they're a lot of fun to listen to. Add Violence has a bit of an angrier, harder edge than the former, and I quite like it. This certainly feels like an artist growing and evolving.<br><br>The long, repetitive breakdown of 'The Background World' bothered me at first, but I don't mind it anymore.

        "description": "Will I be whipped in the town square if I say a post-Staley AIC album is my favourite from the group? Probably. Before I get dragged off in a burlap sack, let me tell you about this awesome album.<br><br>Alice In Chains were thought to be long gone after the death of one of their lead singers—the aforementioned late great Layne Staley. The surviving lineup stayed together, and with the addition of William DuVall, Jerry Cantrell and the gang pulled together and continued producing great music. With this album, you can really feel Cantrell's influence, and you realize that a lot of their greatness in the 1990s is because of his musical genius. They grew as a band, expanded their sound, and they're better than ever.<br><br>It's controversial, for some reason. There's just so many 'fans' out there who hate good music, beat puppies and reject this because it's not the original lineup. Well, 75% of them are still there, and 100% of it is really good music. How many of the Grunge titans of the 90s are still active these days? Some people just can't accept that bands change over the years. Change is good, most of the time—if you're not Billy Corgan.<br><br>My favourite tracks off this one are 'Private Hell' and 'Lesson Learned'. This is my favourite Alice In Chains album. There, I said it. If I don't update this website in the next six months, the angry Staley-loyalist Redditors got me.",

Some of the songs revolve around Billie Joe Armstrong's journey to sobriety after iHeart Radio 2012, while others are more politically charged. 'Youngblood' apparently hails from the <i>Cigarettes and Valentines</i> era, with some other tracks coming from the vault to make an appearence as well. Green Day prove once again that nobody makes music like they do, and they're still at the top of their game.<br><br>I can't believe it's been almost ten years since this album came out at the time of writing. I remember where I was the day all the singles came out! I loved it back then, and I love it more now. Life's changed a lot since the first time I heard it, and I'm in a much better place to enjoy it. Everything's changed, but in some ways, things have stayed the same.

Many fans of these bands swore they'd lever listen to this, and say that all these bands committed treason and crimes against humanity in this switch.<br><br>Progressive Rock became Progressive Pop, and yeah, it's very different, but there's still so much to enjoy. It has awesome guitar work and super catchy hooks; symphonic passages were replaced with solos layered atop bouncing synths to create a spectacular blend of then-contemporary pop and their out-of-this-world progressive origins. Some of these songs were written in conjunction with former Led Zeppelin members Jimmy Page and Robert Plant for a supergroup called 'XYZ' which never came to light. You've got <i>80s Pop</i> music, then you've got <i>Progressive Pop</i>—the latter wins every time.<br><br>Random fun fact: the title of the album is the catalogue ID of the album.

Whether you like Progressive Rock or not, you can really enjoy this one; these guys took their experience in being a pioneering band in one scene, and blazed their own trail in another.

This is a collection of songs that's easy to listen to and fun for anyone who likes fun (and rock n' roll).<br><br>I listened to this one a lot in the summer of 2016, and becuase of that, I think of it as a 'summer' album. After that, I didn't think about it again until 2024 when I picked up a copy, and I was shocked at how good it was as a whole. My favourite tracks off this one are 'Tales', 'Joker & The Thief' and 'White Unicorn'. I think 'Tales' is the best one off the album; it's a really good song. ",

Instead, he revamped the band and released the eponymous <i>Whitesnake</i>, and I'm glad he did. So is my Dad; he really liked this album and \"played it until the tape wore out\".<br><br>This is an electrifying record. When I think of heavy metal in the 1980's, I think of albums like this one. It's loud, dramatic, jam-packed with anthems, and so much fun to listen to; it starts up and sends you on your way, yet it's paced well (as many mainstream 80s albums were) and its easy to listen to. The sound gives off the air of being more mysterious and sophisticated than a band like Mötley Crüe, but you still want to rock out to it just as hard. <br><br>My favourite tracks on this one are 'Crying In The Rain', 'Here I Go Again' and 'Is This Love'.",

        "description": "This album has a colossal shadow; no longer the new angsty young men on the block, The Clash absorbed influences left and right, refined their sound, and released one of the great double-albums of history. While their previous album <i>Give 'Em Enough Rope</i> marked a subtle shift from their original sound, this one was a huge departure. This is the album that really made me respect The Clash and its members for their songwriting ability, their ability to grow as artists, and their ability as music listeners to appreciate so many different kinds of music.<br><br>When I was a young lad, I was a <i>Warning</i> hater—\"how could Green Day do this!?\"; \"It's just not Green Day!\". I was equally confused when I first heard some of the songs on <i>London Calling</i>, but after a couple of tracks, I started to understand that this was still The Clash that I knew and loved, but different. Their signature style and charm was stil there packed in with influences different to the ones which made me love them originally. This album is what cured me of being a <i>Warning</i> hater and opened my mind to many more kinds of music—especially music from bands that changed over time. Green Day was just following in the footsteps of one of the greatest, most diverse bands in history when they began to grow from their 924 Gilman St origins.<br><br>Whether you like punk rock or not, you'll like this album: it's got something for everybody. My favourite songs off it are 'The Card Cheat', 'The Guns of Brixton', 'Spanish Bombs', 'Rudie Can't Fail' and the titular 'London Calling'.",

From the album cover to the final track, this album is made to suck you in and have you enjoy it; these songs are catchy, bouncy and generally upbeat tunes. Heck, even the ones with sadder lyrics sound happy! It's just a great album that I'd recommend to anyone: if you like Progressive Rock's grand compositions, attention to detail and sonic diversity, you'll enjoy this; if you enjoy pop music, you'll enjoy this—it was once part of the unintelligible blob that was contemporary pop. Give this one a chance!<br><br>My favourite tracks on this album are 'Gone Hollywood', 'Gone Hollywood' and 'Casual Conversations'.

        "description": "There are two kinds of beauty in the world: that which can and cannot be quantified and understood. In our every day lives, we experience and see things that are beautiful. It's human nature to try and quantify everything we see because we're so obsessed with numbers statistics—we've always been like that, and we always will be.<br><br>If you look at a sweet rose, you can understand it's beautiful inside and out. It's nice to be around and brings pleasure to the eye; it can be quantified, understood and described, though it shouldn't have to be. In classical music, I would equate this to the second movement of Richard Strauss' <i>Also Sprach Zarathustra</i>, 'Von den Hinterweltlern'.<br><br>Then, you have the beauty which cannot be understood. I try to watch the sunset every day, and I don't try to understand why it's beautiful or put it into words. What's the point of trying to understand something so powerful when you could just take it in and enjoy it instead? I feel the same way about the eighteenth variation of <i>Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini</i>. In this composition, Rachmaninoff makes me feel things that no other piece of music or thing makes me feel—nothing but the sight of a sunset. I don't understand how a mortal man created this beauty, but he did. It's powerful and I won't bother trying to put it into words or trying to understand it. I first heard it in 2013 when Lang Lang's recording of it was used as the intro to <i>Gran Turismo 6</i>, and I've loved it since.<br><br>As a whole, <i>Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini</i> is a rollercoaster ride, and I love it. It's very short and a joy to listen to, but it's something I don't listen to often becuase of the power that eighteenth variation holds. When it comes on, it's like being hit really hard by something invisible: I stop what I'm doing and just take it in; oftentimes, my eyes get sweaty.
