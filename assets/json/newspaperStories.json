His Q3 lap is being hailed as the best of his career, with Fernando Alonso piling on the praise for Max's performance in an underwhelming car. Max was somehow faster than Lando Norris for the whole race, and after McLaren refused to let Piastri through, he crossed the line in first place. This was Max Verstappen's sixty-forth win and the first this season.<br><br>Personally, I think this was the third consecutive race where Oscar outpaced Lando. They didn't let him past in Australia, and they didn't let him past this year either. It just doesn't make sense! I'm also very happy that its Max who is toppling Vettel's records; I'm sentimental about that era of Red Bull and Formula 1, and I wouldn't want any driver to replace Vettel in the history books. ",

George Russell has been very consistent, so that's great for him. LeClerc did an outstanding drive with a broken front wing, though I suspect a broken front wing endplate isn't always a bad thing from the amount of times I've seen this happen. Stroll surprised me more than he ever has—a great drive from him, and a great drive from Bearman as well. ",
