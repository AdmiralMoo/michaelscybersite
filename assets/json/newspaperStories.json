With this win, he is currently the only Formula 1 driver to have a 100% pole-to-win conversion rate—a cool stat, but one that can't last forever.<br><br>I've been saying it since he was in Formula 2: this guy is going to be a world champion. It was clear over the past couple seasons that he's been learning a lot every race, and now he's really starting to shine. Piastri WDC 2025!",

His Q3 lap is being hailed as the best of his career, with Fernando Alonso piling on the praise for Max's performance in an underwhelming car. Max was somehow faster than Lando Norris for the whole race, and after McLaren refused to let Piastri through, he crossed the line in first place. This was Max Verstappen's sixty-forth win and the first this season.<br><br>Personally, I think this was the third consecutive race where Oscar outpaced Lando. They didn't let him past in Australia, and they didn't let him past this year either. It just doesn't make sense! I'm also very happy that its Max who is toppling Vettel's records; I'm sentimental about that era of Red Bull and Formula 1, and I wouldn't want any driver to replace Vettel in the history books. ",

LeClerc did an outstanding drive with a broken front wing, though I suspect a broken front wing endplate isn't always a bad thing from the amount of times I've seen this happen.
