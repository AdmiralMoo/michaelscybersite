        "date" : "04/06/2025",
        "body" : "After a magnificent pole lap which saw Max Verstappen take the overall lap record at Suzuka from Sebastian Vettel, he has won Sunday's Japanese Grand Prix. His Q3 lap is being hailed as the best of his career, with Fernando Alonso piling on the praise for Max's performance in an underwhelming car. Max was somehow faster than Lando Norris for the whole race, and after McLaren refused to let Piastri through, he crossed the line in first place. This was Max Verstappen's sixty-forth win and the first this season.<br><br>Personally, I think this was the third consecutive race where Oscar outpaced Lando. They didn't let him past in Australia, and they didn't let him past this year either. It just doesn't make sense! I'm also very happy that its Max who is toppling Vettel's records; I'm sentimental about that era of Red Bull and Formula 1, and I wouldn't want any driver to replace Vettel in the history books. ",

        "body" : "Oscar Piastri crossed the line ahead of McLaren teammate Lando Norris and Mercedes driver George Russell today in a statement drive at the Shanghai International Circuit. After McLaren wouldn't let him pass Lando last week and wet weather sent him spinning into the grass, Oscar has rebounded and led the team this weekend while Lando complained about this and that behind.<br><br>I was overjoyed to see the way he handled the race. George Russell has been very consistent, so that's great for him. LeClerc did an outstanding drive with a broken front wing, though I suspect a broken front wing endplate isn't always a bad thing from the amount of times I've seen this happen. Stroll surprised me more than he ever has—a great drive from him, and a great drive from Bearman as well. ",

I'm not a fan of Norris—I never have been—but right from the get-go in his F3 days, Piastri seemed like a guy I could get behind. This season, I hope to see Piastri vs Verstappen vs LeClerc for the title, the latter of which unfortunately doesn't seem all that realistic at the moment.",

It feels so weird knowing that he's gone becuase he was so full of life; he's not what you'd picture when you think of a man in the latter half of his seventies.
