I love the feeling of this movie, just as I love the feeling of my other favourite movies. There's something about them I just can't describe, but they all share it.<br><br>John Williams' soundtrack is amazing here as well—it really brings the world to life.

Maybe I just like it so much because—although my life didn’t feature nearly as much disco action—I feel like I can relate to the feelings of alienation from my peers and wanting to move up in the world. I felt like I lived through the plot of this movie in parallel over the course of ten months—it started with me getting a surprise raise and ended with me growing up but not getting the girl.<br><br>Throughout those ten months, this movie made me feel like I wasn’t as lost as I thought I was, and everyone is faking it just as much as I am.
