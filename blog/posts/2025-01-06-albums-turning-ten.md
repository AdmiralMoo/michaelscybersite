For the past year, I kept listening to Revolution Radio thinking “I can’t believe this album is about to turn ten years old!” Lo-and-behold—with the coming of 2026—exactly that will happen on October 7th. 

I listened to the radio a lot in 2016—back then, it was *94.9 The Rock* broadcasting out of CYOO, the local airport. I remember that summer somewhat fondly with warm afternoons and long bike rides between the chaos of my life at the time. 

That said, I decided to take a look back at a couple albums I remember fondly from that year. 
###WOLFMOTHER/VICTORIOUS
This was my introduction to Wolfmother when I first heard the titular single “Victorious” on the air. 
###BLINK-182/CALIFORNIA
Honestly, I’ve never particularly loved the bulk of Blink-182’s music, but I liked California the moment I heard it. “She’s Out of Her Mind” is such a banger!
###BILLY TALENT/AFRAID OF HEIGHTS
Billy Talent is a surprisingly consistent band, having started off with a strong, signature sound and continued with it all the way through. This was a solid entry into their discography. 
###RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS/THE GETAWAY
Similar to Blink-182, I’m not a huge Chili Peppers fan. I enjoyed By The Way the most out of all their albums, but The Getaway is decent too. 
###GREEN DAY/REVOLUTION RADIO
I might be biased, but to me, this is the crown jewel of the year, one of the best releases of the decade, and my favourite Green Day album. 

I listened to “Bang Bang” and “Revolution Radio” so many times that summer. I remember the album leaking the day before it came out, but I waited for October 7th to hear it in full. It was proof that they still had it, and in 2026, they’re still going strong!

I suppose out of all these albums, this one means the most to me and it’s stayed with me through many different parts of my life now. That’s why it’s the most difficult to believe that it’s coming up on ten years ago.  
###SUM 41/13 VOICES 
What a comeback for Sum 41! This album is freaking awesome and it feels like it’s got direction, unlike their previous two efforts. It integrates their heavy metal/punk rock sound and still proved they could write hits. 
###KINGS OF LEON/WALLS
I haven’t listened to much Kings of Leon outside of Walls, and that was simply because it got a lot of airtime that summer. It’s not an album I revisit often, but when I do, I enjoy it. 
###NINE INCH NAILS/NOT THE ACTUAL EVENTS
2016 ended off with a bang—the return of Nine Inch Nails after Hesitation Marks. Say what you will about their more mature, less angry-sounding music: this is just as angry, just as good and a lot of fun to listen to.
