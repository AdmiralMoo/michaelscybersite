While walking down Bank Street after seeing the New Years fireworks at Lansdowne Park, I passed by the Mayfair Theatre and a very familiar movie poster: Logan’s Run (1976). I’ve seen it once before, albeit at home on my computer, and I decided it would be cool to see in theatres. The screening was on January 4th, 2026, at 21:00. 
###THE MOVIE
It’s a sci-fi flick set in a dystopian future where lab-grown humans in a protected settlement are killed at the age of thirty. If they don’t show up to their death ceremony—disguised as a rebirth ritual called “Carousel”—they’re hunted down by “Sandmen”. 

The main character, Logan 5 (Michael York), is one of these Sandmen. He questions the system, discovers things he shouldn’t have and goes on a whole fantastic journey to discover the truth behind their wonky society and the fate of the outside world.

The movie’s effects were pretty impressive for the time and it was brought to life by director Michael Anderson and a relatively high budget of around eight million. The dialogue is well-written—though sometimes corny, scenes are well-shot and acting really isn’t all that bad. It’s everything you could want from a quirky 70’s sci-fi movie, in my opinion.

The music is composed by film legend Jerry Goldsmith, who did countless other soundtracks—including various Star Trek films and series, Planet of The Apes and Alien amongst many others. 
###THE THEATRE
Tickets were $13.00 at the door. The theatre opened in 1932 so it’s a little worn down, but it feels real. Nothing in there—from the time you walk in to the time you leave—feels forced or choreographed by the clueless marketing department of a major corporation. It’s got a kind of magic you just can’t capture or recreate.

This was my first time at The Mayfair Threatre. The theatre itself small compared to an IMAX cinema, but grandiose in design. The ceiling is domed and there are ornamental fixtures and facias. The popcorn walls are painted an obnoxious shade of yellow and red; the ceiling is bare concrete grey and from one of the fake porches off to the right, the bare skeleton of the T-101 stares down imposingly upon us. 

Before the movie started, the screen showed a mix of ads, previews for upcoming screenings and historic photos: a tall, svelte, blonde woman bends down to pick a can of beans from a Mayfair Markets shelf; The Mayfair Theatre screens a new movie in the 1950’s with Hudson taxi cabs trundling about the streets; When Harry Met Sally is to be screened in a couple weeks as a tribute to the late Rob Reiner. 

Classical music played softly through the speakers. Much to my delight, they played “An Der Schonen, Blauen Donau” and “ Einleitung” (the first movement of Richard Strauss’ Also Sprach Zarathustra) back-to-back! Two of my favourite works from two of my favourite classical composers. This was followed by what seemed to be the freaky choral part the 2001 soundtrack from when the monoliths aligned at Jupiter and Beyond. 

###THE EXPERIENCE
It felt good to watch a good movie in theatres. I’ve been to a couple recently, and it didn’t feel like this. 

Everybody was very present during the movie, and you could feel that. The audience was mature enough to not talk or turn on their phones during the screening; we all laughed along with Old Man’s (Peter Ustinov) comedic senility and gripped our seats every time Francis 7 (Richard Jordan) fired on Logan 5 and Jessica 6.

It felt good to walk up to the ticket booth and ask for a ticket to see Logan’s Run. I’ve never actually done that before; I saw ticket booths when I was younger, but I’ve only ever experienced the hassle of ordering tickets ahead of time and finagling with smartphones. My Dad laughed at me—and rightfully so—but I was admittedly taken aback at the simplicity of walking into a theatre, buying a ticket and sitting down. 

I’ve gone out of my way to watch a lot of old sci-fi movies on my own—Logan’s Run as I said before, was one of them—but there is nothing like going to theatres and watching a movie for real. 

I look forward to going back for many more movie nights like this one.
